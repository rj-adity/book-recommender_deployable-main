# BOOK-RECOMMENDER-SYSTEM

I have developed a book recommender system deployed on my local host using PyCharm. The system utilizes two recommendation strategies: a popularity-based approach that highlights trending books and a collaborative filtering method that analyzes user ratings to suggest books that align with individual preferences. This dual approach ensures that users receive both widely accepted recommendations and personalized suggestions based on their reading history, enhancing their overall experience.

## RECOMMENDATION TYPES
Recommendation systems can be categorized into 4 main types: 

1Ô∏è‚É£Popularity-based systems, which highlight trending content like YouTube's trending section or IMDb's top movies

2Ô∏è‚É£Content-based systems, which assess similarity based on attributes like actors or themes

3Ô∏è‚É£Collaborative filtering systems, which rely on user ratings

4Ô∏è‚É£Hybrid systems, like Netflix's, which combine multiple approaches to enhance recommendations.
